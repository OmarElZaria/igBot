# igBot

# With the use of Python, Selenium and Chrome WebDriver I was able to develop an instagram bot 
# that allows you to find out the list of all the accounts that don't follow you back.


# I have completely automatesd the process of logging into a specific instagram account 
# and the bot is able to navigate to your profile page in order to fetch the list of all your 'following' and 'followers' 
# and then compares both lists and returns a new list to the user only containing the accounts of people that don't follow you back.

# In order for the bot to run, make sure to add your username and password into the inputs file
